To start, simply double click on the “build” program. Doing so will bring up a simple text editor, within which you will be able to program in C++ to your heart’s content. Once you are done, the program will automatically compile your code once you exit out of the text editor.

Once the program compiles your code, it will display easy to understand descriptions for errors and warnings in your code. You can find more detail by clicking the highlighted errors.
